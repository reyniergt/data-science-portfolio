            "content": "The Challenge The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. . On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. . While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. . Our goal is to be able to predict who survived. .

There are 708 rows with null values, lets take it into consideration Now, lets start exploring the survival rate . sns.countplot(x=&#39;Survived&#39;, data=train_df) . &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x1a23c83cd0&gt; . Unfortunatly, more than 500 people died vs 300 survivors, which means a random person is more likely to died instead of survive. Lets explore now the relationship between survival rate and our colums, starting with Pclass. . sns.countplot(x=&#39;Pclass&#39;, hue=&#39;Survived&#39;, data=train_df) . &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x1a23d444d0&gt; . As we can see, a person in first class is more likely to survive, while a person in third class is more likely to perish Second class doesnt show a big diference. This could be explained by people of higher social classes having priority to board the boats, or by the distance from every class to the boats (Remember first class were closer to the top of the ship, while lower classes were closer to the bottom). . Lets go with sex. . sns.countplot(x=&#39;Sex&#39;, hue=&#39;Survived&#39;, data=train_df) . &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x1a23dccb10&gt; . Males are more likely to die, while females are more likely to survive. It could be explained by women having priority to board the boats. . agegrouped = train_df[[&#39;Survived&#39;, &#39;Age&#39;]] agegrouped[&#39;group&#39;] = agegrouped[&#39;Age&#39;].floordiv(10) agegrouped . /Users/reyniergonzalez/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ipykernel_launcher.py:2: SettingWithCopyWarning: A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame. Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead See the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy . Survived Age group . 0 0 | 22.0 | 2.0 | . 1 1 | 38.0 | 3.0 | . 2 1 | 26.0 | 2.0 | . 3 1 | 35.0 | 3.0 | . 4 0 | 35.0 | 3.0 | . ... ... | ... | ... | . 886 0 | 27.0 | 2.0 | . 887 1 | 19.0 | 1.0 | . 888 0 | NaN | NaN | . 889 1 | 26.0 | 2.0 | . 890 0 | 32.0 | 3.0 | . 891 rows × 3 columns . sns.countplot(x=&#39;group&#39;, hue=&#39;Survived&#39;,data=agegrouped) . &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x1a23f3d150&gt; . It seems children 0-10 years are more likely to survive, while elders 60+ didnt make it. The range 10-60 has a more probability to perish, especially the 20-30 which has a strong tendency to die. This could be explained by the childrens having priority to board the botes, while young ones were left last. . Lets explore the relationship between travel companions and survival probabilities . train_df[&#39;travel_companions&#39;] = train_df[&#39;SibSp&#39;]+train_df[&#39;Parch&#39;] sns.countplot(x=&#39;travel_companions&#39;, hue=&#39;Survived&#39;,data=train_df) . &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x1a23fd8690&gt; . It seems like small families (1 to 3 companions had bigger survival probabilities than the rest). Remember women and children had also bigger survival chances. . sns.catplot(x=&#39;Survived&#39;, y=&#39;Fare&#39;,data=train_df) . &lt;seaborn.axisgrid.FacetGrid at 0x1a23f35d10&gt; . It seems there isnt a strong relationship between fare and survival, except for those who paid the most (we can infer those who traveled in first class) . We would think there shouldnt be any relationship between survival and name, ticket number and embarcation port. But just in case lets explore it. . sns.countplot(hue=&#39;Survived&#39;, x=&#39;Embarked&#39;, data=train_df) . &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x1a241cfa50&gt; . It looks like those embarked in S(Southampton) and Q(Queenstown) had more probability to die, while those embarqued on C(Cherbourg) had a minimal improve in its survival probabilities. Lets explore why could be that. . sns.countplot(hue=&#39;Pclass&#39;, x=&#39;Embarked&#39;, data=train_df) . &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x1a23fd0e90&gt; . As we can see, people who embarked on C(Cherbourg) were mainly first class, while the rest were mainly third. Lets remember those in first class had more probability to survive. . This exploration show us the main signals we could use for predicting who survived: . Sex | Pclass | Age | Travel companions (SibSp and Parch) | Embarked | . in order to start training, lets split our dataset in two (train and eval) . In first place we need to preprocess our dataset . Lets start by treating missing data .

Our dataset seems to be ready for training. In order to do this lets start by spliting our data in two datasets, for training and testing. . features_df = df[FEATURES] labels_df = df[LABEL] . from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split train_features, test_features, train_labels, test_labels = train_test_split(features_df, labels_df, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) . train_features.shape . (711, 5) . test_features.shape . (178, 5) . Our train dataset has 711 rows vs 178 in our test dataset Lets start by choosing a DecisionTree classifier . from sklearn import tree model = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier() model.fit(train_features, train_labels) . DecisionTreeClassifier(ccp_alpha=0.0, class_weight=None, criterion=&#39;gini&#39;, max_depth=None, max_features=None, max_leaf_nodes=None, min_impurity_decrease=0.0, min_impurity_split=None, min_samples_leaf=1, min_samples_split=2, min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0, presort=&#39;deprecated&#39;, random_state=None, splitter=&#39;best&#39;) . Our model is trained and ready for predicting. Lets try some . model.predict(train_features.head(5)) . array([1, 0, 0, 0, 0]) . Now we need to evaluate our model. As this is a classification problem, we need to use two main metrics: precision and recall. . from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, accuracy_score . Compute the precision . The precision is the ratio tp / (tp + fp) where tp is the number of true positives and fp the number of false positives. The precision is intuitively the ability of the classifier not to label as positive a sample that is negative. . The best value is 1 and the worst value is 0. . accuracy_score(train_labels, model.predict(train_features)) . 0.8734177215189873 . accuracy_score(test_labels, model.predict(test_features)) . 0.8033707865168539 . precision_score(train_labels, model.predict(train_features)) . 0.9371980676328503 . precision_score(test_labels, model.predict(test_features)) . 0.765625 . Compute the recall . The recall is the ratio tp / (tp + fn) where tp is the number of true positives and fn the number of false negatives. The recall is intuitively the ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples. . The best value is 1 and the worst value is 0. . recall_score(train_labels, model.predict(train_features)) . 0.7158671586715867 . recall_score(test_labels, model.predict(test_features)) . 0.7101449275362319 . Our DecisionTree model shows a precision of 77% and a recall of 71% in the test dataset. Lets try to improve it using a different model . from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier forest = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10) forest.fit(train_features, train_labels) forest.predict(train_features.head(5)) . array([1, 0, 0, 0, 0]) . Now, lets evaluate the forest classifier using the same metrics . accuracy_score(train_labels, forest.predict(train_features)) . 0.8720112517580872 . accuracy_score(test_labels, forest.predict(test_features)) . 0.8089887640449438 . precision_score(train_labels, forest.predict(train_features)) . 0.9285714285714286 . precision_score(test_labels, forest.predict(test_features)) . 0.7692307692307693 . recall_score(train_labels, forest.predict(train_features)) . 0.7195571955719557 . recall_score(test_labels, forest.predict(test_features)) . 0.7246376811594203 . There seems to be an improvement of 1% in for both precision and recall in favor of the RandomForest model .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
